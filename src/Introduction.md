What are react Hooks?
Hooks are special functions that allow us to use state and other React features in functional components.

Earlier, when we used to create react app using Functional component, then we didn't have access to the state management and lifecycle methods.
To access these features we had to add class components.


But after introducing React Hooks from version 16.8, we can now use state mangement and other react features without writing class components.

In other words, Hooks are the functions that make functional components work like class components.

Developer prefer functional components over class components.
